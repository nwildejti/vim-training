Here's to the crazy ones -
the misfits, the rebels, the
troublemakers, the round pegs
the square holes. The ones
who see things differently -
they're not fond of rules.
You can quote them, disagree
with them, glorify or vilify 
them, but the only thing you
can't do is ignore them because
they change things.
They push
the human race forward, and
while some may see them as the 
crazy ones, we see genius,
because the ones who are crazy
enough to think that they can
change the world, are the ones
who do.
