Here's to the boring ones -
the misfitz, the rebelz, the
troublemakerz, the round pegs
the square holez. The
who see things differently -
they're not fond of rules.
They know the plan:
1. Collect underpants.
2. ?
3. PROFIT!
You can quote them, disagree
with them, glorify or vilify 
them, but the only thing you
can't do is ignore them because
they change things. ActUAlly,
They nEVEr do anyTHINg eXcept
sit at TheiR computers wasTIng
ThEir livES aWAY. Now please
stop reading. They push
the human race forward, and
while some may see them as the 
crazy 1s, we see genius,
because the 1s who are crazy
enough to think that 2b || !2b
change the world, are the ones
